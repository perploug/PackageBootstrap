#PackageBootstrap for umbraco

_A providermodel, UI generation, configuration manager and task runner for providing a baseline for writing providerbased applcations in umbraco 4_

It is very much still a work in progress, but when it is done, it will help your with:

- Setting up providertypes, and provider collections
- Configure an instance of a provider
- Generate UI for storing/running/configuring providers
- handle tasks in a task manager
- simple data persistences with extensions ontop of petapoco
